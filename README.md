# üéì Git Student Learn ‚Äì Fun React Playground

This is a simple and playful React + TailwindCSS application, created as a small experiment.

## üéØ Purpose

The app was designed with two goals in mind:

1. **Assist Afeka students** in getting familiar with Git, GitHub, and React-based development through a visual and interactive project.
2. **Test how AI can collaborate in real-time** to build and deploy simple but functional web applications.

It serves as a sandbox to explore:
- React components and logic
- TailwindCSS layout and responsiveness
- GitHub Pages deployment
- AI-assisted development workflows
